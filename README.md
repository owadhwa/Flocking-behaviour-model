# Flocking-behaviour-model

Here I simulate the flocking behaviour of animals using an agent based model. The boids model was invented by Craig Reynolds, who describes it as follows:  
"In 1986 I made a computer model of coordinated animal motion such as bird flocks and fish schools. It was based on three dimensional computational geometry of the sort normally used in compouter animaiton or computer aided design. I called the generic simulated flocking creatures boids. The basic flocking model consists of three simple steering behaviours which describe how an individual boid maneuvers based on the positions and velocities its nearby flockmates:  
- Separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates  
- Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flocakmates  
- Cohersion: steer to move toward the average position of local flockmates"

This simuation is based on the one found at https://agentpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/agentpy_flocking.html
